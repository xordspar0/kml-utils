This is a set of command line utilities for dealing with KML files.

* main.kml is a demo of retrieving information from a server from inside KML.
  radius.py is the script that runs on the server.
* csv2kml.py and kml2csv.py are scripts that convert to and from simple CSV
  files. A file that csv2kml.py is capable of reading, data/locations.csv, is
  included.
* kmlmerge.py combines two kml files into one.
* noaa2kml.py takes a CSV file from NOAA that contains locations of storm
  events in the United States and converts it to KML. It reads from
  data/StormEvents_locations-ftp_v1.0_d2010_c20140824.csv. It also retreives
  data from data/StormEvents_details-ftp_v1.0_d2010_c20140824.csv. Since these
  files are both unsorted, looking up information in the details file currently
  takes a very long time. To make testing this script easier, I made a
  truncated version of the locations file, data/storm_loc_trunc.csv. This file
  only has 1000 records.

Each of the command line scripts includes a usage message that demonstrates
what arguments it needs.
