## Bugs and Improvements ##

[X]	eliminate false positives when checking the option argument in both scripts
[X]	eliminate blank lines when converting from KML to CSV and vice versa
[X] add path support to kml2csv.py
[X]	fix the scripts accepting too few arguments when using an option
[X]	switch from "-t=path" to "-t path" syntax (it's more natural and expected)
[ ] csv2kml should choose a delimiter at the beginning and stick with it
[ ] noaa2kml became very slow when I added the event type lookup to it
[X] noaa2kml should skip the header line of the csv files

## KML Project Ideas ##

[X]	Generate KML paths from CSV coordinates.
[X]	Write a script to merge KML files together.
