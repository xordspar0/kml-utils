## Bugs and Improvements ##

[X]	eliminate false positives when checking the option argument in both scripts
[ ]	eliminate blank lines when converting from KML to CSV and vice versa
[ ] add path support to kml2csv.py
[ ]	fix the scripts accepting too few arguments when using an option
[ ]	switch from "-t=path" to "-t path" syntax (it's more natural and expected)
